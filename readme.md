### Outcome: Prioritized Product Backlog

| Priority | Issue # | Title                      | Justification                                                   |
|----------|---------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | #1      | Create a product           | Core CRUD action — catalog can’t exist without it.             |
| 2        | #2      | Retrieve a product         | Enables users to see product details.                          |
| 3        | #3      | Update a product           | Essential for managing product accuracy.                       |
| 4        | #4      | Delete a product           | Necessary for data hygiene.                                    |
| 5        | #5      | Like a product             | Adds user interaction value; simple to implement.              |
| 6        | #6      | Dislike a product          | Complements the like feature.                                  |
| 7        | #9      | Cloud hosting              | Makes the system publicly usable.                              |
| 8        | #10     | Automated cloud deployment | Enables efficient CI/CD workflow.                              |

### Icebox Items
| Issue # | Title                    | Reason                                                   |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| #7      | List all products        | Secondary need; can follow once CRUD is in place.        |
| #8      | Query subset of products | More advanced filtering; not MVP-critical at the moment. |

Notes

* Priority was determined based on business value, technical dependencies, and development complexity.

* MVP focuses on enabling a complete product lifecycle (create, read, update, delete).

* Optional features (like/dislike, listing, querying) were ranked lower unless they supported core goals or DevOps workflows.
